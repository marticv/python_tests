This is a little test in python for work purposes.

We have to many files to process so we want to have a folder to store the initial files while in other we have a limited amount to be processed.
once the folder with files to be processed has space, the scrips adds more files.

Now we add a litle improvment, we just want files .log moved from one folder to other. The scrip will be used on diferent folders with diferent limmits. To avoid mistakes the route and the maximum will be in a separate python file to make it easyer to avoid mistakes.
